            <p class="lead">Environment variables are very fundamental part of developing with Node.js
                or any server side language. They always contains very sensitive data and doesn't meant to be shared
                with outside world. You have to make sure that your server is properly configured to make use of correct
                variables for both development and production environments. Any mistake can lead your server to crash.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Working with environment variable in Node.js is very easy and simple. I will walk you
                through the different approaches of using environment variables in Node.js.</p>
            </p>

            <h2>Using package.json</h2>
            <p class="lead">You are thinking how? But you can pass key=value pairs directly in the npm scripts in the package.json.
                This is a valid a place to put environment variable <b>but not a secure</b> place.</p>

            <p class="lead">Below is an example of setting Node.js execution environment to production on the npm's start script.</p>
            <p class="lead"><b>Note:</b> This will probably won't work with Windows OS</p>
            <pre>
                <code class="prettyprint">"scripts": {
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"start-dev": "PORT=3000 nodemon app.js"
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p class="lead">So now you can run the environment script with this command <b>"npm run start-dev"</b>
                in this case it will run the application on port 3000 if its available and run the app.js through nodemon</p>
